# Aeguana tech task - Jake King-Lee

This is my submission of the Aeguana tech task.

I started this project by using my own Flutter app template from my Github repos. My Flutter app template is a handy way of starting a new project with some basic tools and plugins that I commonly use.

I like to use `stacked` architecture and state management in my apps as I find it easy to use and has less boilerplate than solutions like `bloc`.

I tried to ensure that my UI matches to as close to the Figma design as possible. I also took care to ensure that the user flow through the app felt natural.


Tools used:
  - Flutter
  - Figma
  - Photopea (for online image editing)


Things I would like to improve on:
  - Selecting a meal segment (Meals, Snacks, Sweets, Drinks) will scroll to that section in the list. However scrolling the list will not update the selected segment.
  - Fix the vertical spacing between the bottom nav bar icon and text. This was not possible with the package that I used for the bottom nav bar.
  - Add more unit tests.
  - Add more widget tests.
